// NOTE: The number of worthless items gained at the end may be less than  the gums you used because we have to get all the other starter items too. However, if you started with all the starter items already, then you should receive as many worthless items as gums used.

// Script basically buys gums for you, then gets all starter items. It will place the worthless item in your closet and fish for it again. This is repeated until you have no more gum.

//But if you lack sufficient gums to ensure a 100% worthless item fish, the script will take a gamble and use all your gums on hand anyway. Cross your fingers!.
